## Welcome!

Hi. We're glad to have you.

## Getting Into The Office!

Hit "Start", then #7300.

Set you up with a bunch of Josephine-ish accounts and services. I'd recommend logging through this list, poking around, and making sure all of your accounts work. If not, let me know!

## Email

You should now have a @josephine.com email address. Make sure you upload an avatar and, if you want, a signature! We can find some time to take headshots at some point.

> You can set up a new account here: 

### Email Groups

- team@josephine.com – This goes to everybody on the team, including contractors.
- hello@josephine.com – Our contact email on the website.
- cooks@josephine.com – Mailing list for cooks to talk amongst themselves ('til we have a forum)
- cooksupport@josephine.com – For cooks to talk with our cook operations team.
- accounts@josephine.com – We use this email for all accounts we sign up for (see the Accounts doc)

## Slack

This is our company wide chat. You should have received an invite.

> You can add the new person here: https://josephine-meals.slack.com/admin/invites

## The Admin Screen

This is our in-app admin screen, where we can do all sorts of admin-y type things. It's always a work in progress but feel free to poke around!

## Google Drive

We use Google Drive for all of our files. You should have access to a "Josephine" folder here: https://drive.google.com/a/josephine.com/folderview?id=0B-xEryEZORfWMEMxZzBnODhfbXc&usp=sharing

Also, make sure to install the Google Drive app for Mac.

This lets you sync your Google Drive files locally on your computer (just like Dropbox!)

**Trello**

Trello is a lil task management app, for now we use it for two things: the Cook Funnel and Product Roadmapping. You should've gotten invites for both boards.

**Github**

We use this for project management, wikis, and code.

Can you create an account and write me back with your username?

**Account Access**

Check out the Accounts doc in Google Drive. It has the login information for all of the services we use. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yv_Fq9ok61bNIIQZ-lXhEC-TRXzVKNxxz1m1bQXjXxw/edit#gid=0

**Facebook Page**

For all sorts of Facebookin'.

I couldn't find you, are you on Facebook?

**Google Analytics**

For all sorts of analytic'ing.

**Oakstop**

I emailed the Oakstop folks to get you set up with all the necessary stuff: booking rooms on Liquid Spaces, the Oakstop Listserv, and filling out your Oakstop profile :)
