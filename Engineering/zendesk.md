Essential vocab:
Agent - the person doing support.

Canned emails.
Canned emails are called **macros** in Zendesks. Macros are like canned emails, on steroids.
Here, I've created a macro to use when people email us expressing interest, but don't live in an area we cover, based on an email that Sika has actually sent out.

This macro automatically fills in the first name of the ticket requestor and the first name of the agent.
I've also configured this macro to automatically tag this ticket with area-not-covered. Tags will allow us to track the types of support requests we're getting. More on that later.
