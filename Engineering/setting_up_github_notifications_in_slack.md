This document describes how to set up Slack so you're notified whenever you're mentioned on GitHub.

1. Join #nerds-github-issues
1. Add your GitHub username (@sike13, @_charleyw, etc) to your highlight words here: https://josephine-meals.slack.com/account/notifications#highlight_words_div
1. Set the channel to "notify me only when mentioned"

Voila! You should now see the red notification numbers any time your name or GitHub username is mentioned in a GitHub issue.

Optional â€“ go to your notification preferences and mute the channel so it doesn't clog your flow. We'll @mention you in GitHub issues and if you don't respond we'll assume you saw it but don't have anything to say :)
