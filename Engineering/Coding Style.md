## Linters

> This is still aspirational and not the case everywhere.

We don't use any linters yet but are hoping to get into that game. The candidates are Rubocop for Ruby, [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) for Javascript, and who knows what else.

## When in doubt, alphabetize

> This is still aspirational and not the case everywhere.

Have a large `routes.rb` file? Alphabetize it.
Class with a lot of methods? Alphabetize them.
Gemfile? Alphabetize. You got it.
