# Josephine Internal Wiki

Hello and welcome to our internal wiki! This is a private repository used mostly for documentation of processes. Everything regarding our employee policies can still be found in our public [Employee Handbook] (https://github.com/josephine/handbook). 

Given our status as a very early stage company with constantly fluctuating processes and tools, this list is not meant to be comprehensive. As a team, we should try to invest in the minimum possible amount of documentation, with a specific emphasis for rounds of new hires. With that in mind, here you go: 

## [New Employee Setup] (./New-Employee-Setup) 
Currently just two documents for onboarding: 
  - [Setting up your computer (for Employees)] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/New%20Employee%20Setup/For%20Employees/Setting%20Up%20Your%20Computer.md)
  - [Setting up new Employees (for Managers)] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/New%20Employee%20Setup/For%20Managers/First%20Day%20Checklist.md)


## [Communications] (./Communications)

Documentation around our core commmunication tools and channels.

##[HR](./HR)

##[Product Tutorials](https://github.com/josephine/wiki/tree/master/Product%20Tutorials)
