# What to do if a meal photo is weird!

If you see a wonky image like this one, here's what you can do:

1. Make sure you're logged in as an admin.
2. Edit that meal (you can just add `/edit` to the end of the URL of the meal, like https://josephine.com/meals/weekday-gumbo/edit)
3. Go into the "Cover Photo" section.
4. Right click on the photo and click "Save Image As" ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/gcrmzi51hzw4tnm/wmyu_jx7.png)

6. Drag the file onto the "Choose File" button. ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/spa/gcrmzi51hzw4tnm/xuv3ssc1.png)
