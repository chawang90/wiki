     Hey `New Josephine Fam,`

     We're very excited for you to join us on Tuesday! 
[Here's an overview] (https://github.com/josephine/handbook/blob/master/Onboarding%20Documents/Welcome%20to%20Josephine.md) of what you can expect from your first day. I've also attached some forms for you to sign but no need to take action on any of this now. 
Before Tuesday, we just need to know if you'd like us to order you a computer to use for work. We've budgeted computers for everyone on the team, but some of us use our personal setups, so let us know what you prefer!
Of course, don't hesitate to reach out if any questions come up. Otherwise, we'll plan see you at Oakstop at 10a on Tuesday :)

     Looking forward, 

5. **Set them up in Zenefits as a new employee** 
   * Trigger Health Insurance & Benefits processes
   * `[Charley to fill out detailed instructions here]`

6. **Email accountants with completed Direct Deposit form to have them add employee to payroll. (or ping Charley to do)**

7. **Send all signed documents to Charley so that he can file them away.**
