# Setting Up Your Computer

Hullo! Presumably you're looking at this page from your new desk at our office and you've already been set up with an @josephine.com email address, access to our Github, and been shared with our Google Drive. Here are some next steps to help you get set up: 

## Josephine Wiki

All of the links below come from our [internal wiki] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki). The point of this document is to consolidate all of the relevant wiki resources specifically in a way that makes the most sense for new employee onboarding. That said, you'll have a bookmark to that page once you set up your bookmarks, and you can always explore at will. 

## Apps

First, I would download and then set up the following desktop applications (mobile isn't a bad idea either):
- Drive ([download] (https://www.google.com/drive/download/)) ([setup] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Drive.md))
- Slack ([download] (https://slack.com/downloads)) ([setup] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Slack.md))
- Chrome ([download] (https://www.google.com/chrome/)) ([setup] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Chrome.md))


## Gmail

Next, you should set up your Gmail filters and get acquainted with our groups & calendars:
- [Gmail] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Gmail.md)

## Communication Tools

Lastly, I would familiarize yourself with some of our communications tools and make sure you're able to access Josephine relevant materials there:

- [Trello] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Trello.md)
- [Github] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Github.md)
- [Meetings] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Meetings.md)

That should be more than enough to get you through the first hour of set up. After everything above is done, feel free to check out the documents in the [HR folder] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/tree/master/HR), which should give you more information on relevant internal processes. 

Keep in mind that this is a collection of living, breathing, (and changing) documents, so If something doesn't make sense or is confusing, please just ask for help. :)
