# Setting Up Your Computer

Hullo! Presumably you're looking at this page on your new computer and you've already been set up with an @josephine.com email address, as well as added to our Github team. Here are some next steps to help you get set up: 

## Apps

First, I would download the following desktop applications (mobile isn't a bad idea either):
- Drive ([download] (https://www.google.com/drive/download/)) ([setup] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Drive.md))
- Slack ([download] (https://slack.com/downloads)) ([setup] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Slack.md))
- Chrome ([download] (https://www.google.com/chrome/)) ([setup] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Chrome.md))

You may want to get Grabbox for taking screenshots easily (connects to your dropbox):

- Grabbox ([download](http://grabbox.devsoft.no/)

## Gmail Filters

Next, you should set up your Gmail filters and get acquainted with our groups & calendars:
- [Gmail] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Gmail.md)

## Communication Tools

Lastly, I would familiarize yourself with some of our communications tools and make sure you're able to access Josephine relevant materials there:

- [Trello] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Trello.md)
- [Github] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Github.md)
- [Meetings] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Meetings.md)

That should be more than enough to get you through the first hour of set up. More to come!
