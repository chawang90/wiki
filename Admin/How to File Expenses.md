# How to File Expenses

In general, business expenses that you incur as a direct result of doing your job are reimbursable by the company. We trust your discretion to act in Josephine's best interests.

## Submitting Expense Reimbursements

In order to submit an expense, you'll need to do the following:

1. If your purchase is over $25, take a photo of the receipt.
2. Fill out this [expense template form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-xEryEZORfWUUlFZEZkaHlnRUk).
3. Send an email to our accountant Megan at mdunne@kranzassoc.com with both files attached.
4. You should receive a response from Megan to confirm that she's received the expense.
5. The reimbursement should appear on your next paycheck.

Voila!
