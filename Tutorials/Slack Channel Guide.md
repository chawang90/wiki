# Slack Channel Guide

A cheatsheet of important Slack channels.

### nerds

Where our developers hang out.

### nerds-*

Lots of notifications for different services. Example:

channel | description
--- | ---
#nerds-airbrake | Airbrake errors. Fun!
#nerds-ci | CircleCI tells us about our build status :apple: / :green_apple:
#nerds-github-issues | New issues created, comments, pull requests, etc.
#nerds-github-commits | New commits on any branch (not just master)
#nerds-zenhub | Zenhub activity like reprioritization, estimation, etc
#nerds-testing | When we programatically create Slack notifications on development, they show up here.
#nerds-reading-club | Talking about good articles, books, etc.
#nerds-heroku | Deployments to production and staging

### #standup

We post our standups in here, ideally by 11am PST. We say (briefly) what we're doing today, and what we did yesterday.

Most people like to use tickmarks to group their standup together.

A real example:

```
Standup 2/24
============

Sorry I didn't standup yesterday. I kind of crashed after lunch and barely made it through the brian/lisette day.

Today I'm working from home and resting as needed.

Yesterday
- Brian Mason reference calls
- Brian Mason and Lisete interview
- Chat with Zeke

Today
- Had to cancel breakfast with Kai Kaiser (developer)
- Schedule Jared Volpe reference calls
- Schedule Daniel Fried
- Send Brian Mason offer
- Ana Mason reference calls
- Work on updating database schema for Josephine Reports (cc @matt)
```

### #retro

We use this channel to do retro – we do retros for teams (biz ops, cook ops, product) as well as individuals (personal feelings, etc.)

Retros follow the conventional format: :), :|, :(

### #product

We talk about all things product. Everyone in the company is here, and often its where we'll hear about bugs, feature requests, etc.

This channel is also where the product team posts sprint recaps after sprint meetings.

### #cooksupport

Where the cook team hangs out to talk about cook stuff.

### #helpscout-hello

This is our email support channel. We use Helpscout, hence the clever name.

### #orders

Every order that comes in, ever.

### #signups

Every signup that comes in, ever.

### #marketing

The whole company talks about marketing stuff.

### #reading

The whole company talks about cool articles.
