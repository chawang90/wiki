# Google Hangouts

It's fun, it's free, it lets you screen share, and it lets you add silly things to your face.

## The 212 Room

> "Meet in 212?"

The [212 Room](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/event/ch212t8askrsvk0ja64d3ak1m68) is where we do most of our hangouts, so bookmark it so it's handy!

We call it the 212 room because the URL has **212** in it. So if you type "212" into your web browser's address bar, it should pop up :)
