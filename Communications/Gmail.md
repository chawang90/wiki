# Gmail
Ah, the joys of Gmail. It's amazing how much of our business is dependent on such a impersonal and bloated tool. Thankfully, it's relatively flexible. The goal here is always to find the balance between granularity of information and efficacy. As always, this is a WIP so please share any improvements or tools you find on your own. 

## Getting Set Up
To get set up, follow the instructions that were sent to your personal email prior to your first day at Josephine. Don't forget set up an Avatar and an email signature. 

## Filters
Email can get really daunting very quickly if you don't have the appropriate filters set up. Your filters will probably evolve to fit your preferences and your role, but we've put together a starter kit of filters that will keep your inbox happy from the get go.

## Calendars

Everyone at Josephine has visibility into everyone else's calendar. This lets us eliminate some of the back and forth involved with scheduling internal meetings. To access other peoples' calendars, simply search their email in the "Other Calendars" section on the left of your Calendar. 

*Please try to check peoples' calendars before sending them invites for meetings or events.* You can toggle calendars after adding them. 

### Shared Calendars
We also have a few shared organizational calendars: 

Calendar | Use Case | Permissions 
--- | --- | --- 
OOO | Out of office dates | Whole team can see and edit 
Hiring | Skills assessments and team fit interviews | Employees can edit, whole team can see 
Office Hours | Josephine Office Hours | Whole team can see and edit 
Taste Tests | Potential Cook Taste Tests | Whole team can see and edit 

## Canned Responses
Running an outreach funnel while trying to keep things personal often means sending templatized emails. There are a bunch of tools to help folks with this, none of them very good. A few people on the team currently use Canned Responses for Gmail, which you can find in Gmail Labs (click the gear ![gear](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OGoJmEwzeVH0DaM5kG2oKS7yFNwjkeLRcc1ylGSicwaj9smx727TraNLXFALog=w72 "Gmail Gear") --> Settings --> Labs).
