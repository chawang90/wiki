# Standing Meetings 

Meetings - something that we've improved a lot at and will need to continue improving at in order to succeed. Walking the line between under- and over- group communication is a skill that we are diligently practicing :). 

Here are the four standing meetings to keep in mind. Links take you to other articles that have more meeting-specific info.
