# Github

Github is a developer tool for hosting versioned content.

We use it to store our code, but we also use it for our company handbook, and internal company wiki.

## Setup

### Github

If you've never used Github, go to github.com and sign up for an account. Then let Tal (@talsafran) know, and he'll add you to our Github team.

Once you've logged in to your account, [set up your notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications) to the following:

Great! These settings will ensure you receive an email every time you're mentioned on Github.

### Zenhub

We also use a tool called Zenhub on top of Github. To install Zenhub, you'll need to go to their website, authorize with your Github account that you've just created, and install their Chrome extension.

Once you've installed Zenhub, you should get access to a new **Boards** tab when you go to Github:

When you click it, you should see screen with the following columns:
