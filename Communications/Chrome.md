# Chrome
Most of us use Google Chrome to browse the series of tubes that is the internet. Pros are mobile/desktop syncing, logged in settings and preferences to your Gmail or Josephine account, and more! Here are some pro-tips:

## Bookmarks
Here's a folder of company bookmarks that are good for general use. Feel free to ask others for updates on more team-specific or emphemerally relevant bookmarks, like Trello boards or planning docs. 

1. Download `josephine-bookmarks.html` [here] (https://drive.google.com/a/josephine.com/folderview?id=0B6ZqkCJ2g5r1TXRsd1ZmbGg2Zmc&usp=sharing).
2. Open Chrome --> Hamburger Menu Icon --> Settings --> Bookmarks --> Import Bookmarks

## Chrome Extensions

There are a ton of great extensions out there but here are a few that the team has adopted for core activities. Let us know if you're using something that you think others might benefit from!

| Extension   | Use Case          |
| ------------- |-------------| 
| [Rapportive] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rapportive/hihakjfhbmlmjdnnhegiciffjplmdhin?hl=en) | Displays background info for an email address in Gmail, typically pulled from LinkedIn. Can also be used for guessing/confirming email addresses. | 
| [ZenHub] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en-US) | Lets us view [GitHub] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/GitHub.md) in "Boards" view - allowing for Trello-esque organization of Issues |
