# Google Drive

As far as cloud storage goes, Dropbox is probably easier to use and more functional than Google Drive. That said, Google Drive is way more free, and it gets the job done well enough. 

## Setup
1. Download the desktop client [here] (https://www.google.com/drive/download/). 
2. Set up syncing so that changes to your Drive live updates for everyone else and vice versa.
3. Not a bad idea to download drive on mobile either. (You can get by without it, totally up to you)

## File Organization
Our latest cleanup of the Drive resulted in these sub-folders within the main Josephine directory:

Folder | Contents
--- | ---
_archive | Old stuff that is probably no longer relevant but that we were too scared to delete
Admin | Insurance, Finances, Licenses, Boring Stuff
Biz Ops | Analytics, Biz Dev, Comms, Legal, Partnerships
Brand | Some half-baked brand guidelines that need to be updated
Cook Ops | Mostly raw documentation of cook wiki, internal processes, and marketing materials
Cross-Team Projects | Where we store docs relevant to collaborative initiatives, including OKRs and goal setting
Design | Logos, Marketing Materials, and other assets
Development | Post Mortems, Keys, Product related research
Fundraising | Decks, Docs, Spreadsheets with tons of white dudes' names on them. :unamused:
HR | Template docs for hires, Onboarding docs, Hiring & Interview related materials
Photos | Photos of us, presumably. I would ask Sika before touching. 
Product | Assorted (and unorganied) research, presentations, and roadmaps from the Product team.

## Best Practices
1. You'll notice a lot of folders named '_archive'. Drive doesn't have great version control so instead of deleting documents that we think are outdated or irrelevant, we can just throw them in _archive. 
2. If you create a new file while you're in Drive, but without having clicked into (just selecting doesn't work) the Josephine directory, it will not be automatically shared or made available to the rest of the team. Since we typically use Drive for collaborative efforts this can be problematic. Make sure you're in the right folder before creating a file to prevent this. 
3. On a similar note, please don't take notes or thoughtlessly create files in Drive. We've done a lot of this in the past and it's made things cluttered very quickly. Use something like [Evernote] (https://evernote.com/download/) to take notes, and share meeting recaps via email or [Slack] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/edit/master/Communications/Slack.md). 
4. Don't forget, you can search Drive easily using the desktop client.
