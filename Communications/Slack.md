# Slack
Slack is how we do emphemeral communication at Josephine. It also serves as a live stream for orders, support inquiries, stand-ups, retros, and silly things. Great for having quick conversations while keeping everyone in the loop and on the same page.

## Setup
1. Sign up for our team [here] (https://josephine-meals.slack.com/signup). 
2. Download the desktop client [here] (https://slack.com/downloads).
3. Download the mobile app.

## Channels
When you first join our Slack team you'll have a few default channels. Here's a quick run through of what they're for:

Channel | Purpose
--- | --- 
#biz-ops | Where biz ops hangs out & posts prioritizations
#cook-ops | Where cook ops hangs out & posts prioritzations
#product | All things product. Bugs, feature requests, etc. Also where sprint meeting redcaps live.
#cook-support | Where we see meals being published to our website real time. Also where conversations specific to helping cooks (reviewing their posts, responding to their emails, going to their meals, etc) are had. 
#helpscout-hello | Our email support channel. We use Helpscout to manage support tickets, hence the clever name. You can click directly on the ticket number to jump right into Helpscout.
#orders | Every order that comes in, ever. 
#signups | Every signup that comes in, ever.
#reading | Where we share interesting or relevant articles with each other. 
#fun | Definitely not where anything fun happens. 
#standup | Where we post daily [standups] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Meetings.md)
#retro | Where we post [weekly retros] (https://github.com/josephine/wiki/blob/master/Communications/Meetings.md) before meeting 

## Posting to #standup and #retro
### #standup

We post our daily standups in here, ideally by 11am PST. We say (briefly) what we're doing today, and what we did yesterday.

A real example:

```
standup 3.4
============

yesterday I did everything on my standup and:
— container inventory & zapier
— drafted 1st meal debrief survey

today:
— meeting w/ terry
— start cook team presentation for onboarding
— review prioritized cook apps and reached out to schedule taste tests
— finish /cooks page project scope
— 1:1 w/ charley
```

### #retro

We use this channel to do retro - we do retros as teams (biz ops, cook ops, product) as well as individually (personal updates, shout-outs/gratitude, emotional recap, etc.)

Team retros use smiley faces :smiley:, :confused:, :disappointed: to organize their work qualitatively. Each team is also responsible for a brief summary of key metrics/releases for the week.

## Product Specific Channels

Our product team also uses Slack for lots of notifications for different services. Example:

channel | description
--- | ---
#nerds | Where our developers hang out.
#nerds-airbrake | Airbrake errors. Fun!
#nerds-ci | CircleCI tells us about our build status :apple: / :green_apple:
#nerds-github-issues | New issues created, comments, pull requests, etc.
#nerds-github-commits | New commits on any branch (not just master)
#nerds-zenhub | Zenhub activity like reprioritization, estimation, etc
#nerds-testing | When we programatically create Slack notifications on development, they show up here.
#nerds-reading-club | Talking about good articles, books, etc.
#nerds-heroku | Deployments to production and staging
