Ello! Set you up with a bunch of Josephine-ish accounts and services. Plz plz make sure they work.


**Josephine Admin**

You can now do stuff on http://josephine.com/admin (user: tal, password: saf). We can do a little walkthrough of this today at some point.


**Email Addresses**

You got 'em already. Add your avatars! Would love to take a new run of headshots of everyone in the office some time this week.


**Dropbox**

It's a shared folder for now, meaning it'll take up your personal space. I actually have an unlimited teams account but need to transfer all my personal stuff out of it.


**Trello**

It's a lil task management app, for now we use it to manage the cook funnel and assign people and stuff.


**Google Drive**

All of our login credentials for other services are in the Accounts doc (under Admin).


**Pivotal Tracker**

We use this for feature acceptance and bug tracking. I'll give you a walkthrough at some point but would **love** for you to be involved in story acceptance (a fancy word for QA testing).

As we add more people to Pivotal I'll be making sure it's always clean and up-to-date.


**Facebook Page**

For all sorts of Facebookin'.
