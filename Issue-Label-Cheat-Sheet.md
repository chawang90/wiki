This is a short cheat sheet for the issue labels we use. Cheat away!

Blocked
-------
I can't work on this until someone does something else. Good to include the issue number of the blocking story.

Bug
-------
This thing is broken. Write code to fix it.

Chore
-------
Some work that needs to get done that doesn't introduce new functionality. An example would be buying an SSL certificate, creating a cook account, or migrating/fixing data.

Copy
-------
There's a typo here! This sentence can be better! Copy suggestions and musings go here.

Data
-------
Generally used for generating data reports –– CSVs, working on the metrics dashboard, or event tracking.

Feature
-------
This is the meaty stuff! Something new that a user can see. It can be an admin too.

Musing
-------
Kind of a catch-all for ponderings with no specific deliverable.

Refactoring
-------
This code sucks! Let's make it better.
