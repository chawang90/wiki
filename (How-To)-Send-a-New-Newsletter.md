Visit https://staging.josephine.com/admin/newsletters -- this is a list of all newsletters. There aren't any on staging yet, but as they are added it will look something like this:

When you create a new newsletter, the default market will be "East Bay", and East Bay meals are displayed by default. When you change the market dropdown, the list of meals will update to only display meals in that market.

To include a meal in the newsletter, click its checkbox. You can also add a note about the meal, but it's not required.

After you've filled out all the required fields, hit save and you'll be redirected to a web-based view of the newsletter. This is the page users will be linked to when the SMS goes out. You should also see a message saying "This is a draft" and a link to keep editing:

Once you're back on the newsletter form page, you'll see this box at the bottom:

Click it and the button text will change:

This checkbox is here to make sure you don't accidentally send out a newsletter before it's ready.
