The newsletter is working end-to-end now, sending emails and such. Here's how it works:

Visit https://staging.josephine.com/admin/newsletters -- this is a list of all newsletters. There aren't any on staging yet, but as they are added it will look something like this:

Click the [Create a  Newsletter] button.

The default market is "East Bay", and East Bay meals are displayed by default. When you change the market dropdown, the list of meals will update to only display meals in that market.

After you've filled out the email subject, headline, body, etc., hit [Save Changes and Preview]

You'll see a web-based version of the newsletter, and a message saying "This is a draft" and a link to keep editing:

Once you're back on the newsletter form page, you'll see a checkbox at the bottom that says "This is really ready I swear". This checkbox is here to ensure the newsletter is not sent out prematurely.

Scheduled delivery of newsletters is not a thing right now. You can edit and preview newsletters as much as you like, but for now you have to manually send them as described above.
