[What you can use your FSA on] (https://help.zenefits.com/Flexible_Spending_Account/Learn_More_about_Medical_FSAs/04-Expenses_Eligible_for_Medical_FSA_Funds) 

For FSA we are just paying administrative fees - all contribution would be coming out of your paycheck pre-tax.
For commuter benefits, we’re contributing $220 per month, which is comparable to $5 for each time to travel to or from the office.
You can add up to $35 more to the commuter benefits pre-tax, after that point it’s taxed just like the rest of your paycheck
all of this comes on a shiny zenefits card that you can use for public transit or even parking!


*The FSA*

*What is it?*
As a company, because of the low-deductible health care plan that we have, we are eligible for having an FSA, not an HSA. In a nutshell, an FSA allows employees to use pre-tax money for healthcare expenses, which means you could save up to 30%-40% on your healthcare expenses(like copays and contacts).

*What's covered?* 
See this list https://help.zenefits.com/Flexible_Spending_Account/Medical_Flexible_Spending_Accounts_(FSAs)/04-Expenses_Eligible_for_Medical_FSA_Funds

*How would I use it?*
After Josephine completes the FSA enrollment, we'd have 10 days to enroll. Once enrolled, we'd receive master card in 7-10 days, which can be used like any credit card.

*Any caveats?*
Each individual chooses how much they want to put into the FSA yearly. The maximum is $2550. If the person doesn't use the whole amount they've elected that year, the next year, Josephine can choose whether to give them a 2.5 month extension (more time to use the funds), or up to $500 will roll over. Any money the employee doesn't use stays with the company. If an employee, for instance, elects $1000 at the beginning of the year, the entire $1000 is available to them at the beginning of the year. If they use the $1000, and then leave before the end of the year, the company cannot recover that $1000. This usually balances out though - between employees not using the full amount, and employees leaving.
 
*Josephine cost*
Standard package: $4 per employee (with a 5 employee minimum), paid for 12 months up front. No refunds if an employee leaves or is terminated. 
Month-to-month: $5 per employee (with a 5 employee minimum), paid each month.
Both packages incur a $150 annual fee. 
So for us, with 7 FT employees, it would be $178/year ($150 + 7*4).

*Dependent childcare FSA*
The FSA is made up of two umbrellas: healthcare expenses, and dependent childcare expenses. No additional cost to elect dependent FSA benefits.

*What's next?*
 If we want to do this: the soonest we'd be able to start is March 1. We'd need to set it up before Feb 15.

*Commuter benefits*

*The basics*
Employees can use pre-tax money for commuting. Covers parking and transit. Within each category, the max that can be contributed per month is $255.

*Josephine cost*
Same as FSA cost. 

*Cool things*
Employees can change contribution whenever they want (before 25th of the month), and it goes into effect for the next month. That means that you can start with a certain amount, and then increase/decrease it depending on whether you anticipate transportation costs will be higher or lower the next month. 

The zenefits mastercard can be used for both commuting expenses and for FSA healthcare expenses. It uses the merchant code when you purchase to figure out which category it should draw money from.

*What's next?*
Employer can set up commuter benefits at anytime. Employees can elect to join or stop or change contributions at any time, on a monthly cycle.
