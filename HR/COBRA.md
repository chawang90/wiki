How do I apply to COBRA?
You will mail it to me after processed my termination.
Cannot do it online.
I can email them after termination to request packet via email..
Deductibles
Deductibles do not reset, woohoo! They reset at end of calendar year.
How long do I have to apply?
Within 60 days.
Benefits reinstated retroactively. Meaning if I'm terminated 7/27 but only finish applying 9/1, I will still get coverage starting 7/27.
