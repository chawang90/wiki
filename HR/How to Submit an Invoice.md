# Invoicing

Hello contractors. Sorry this isn't an optimized process quite yet but here's how we do invoicing at Josephine as of 3.9.2016. 

1. Fill out an invoice (feel free to use your own template but we have one [here] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6ZqkCJ2g5r1MXBQOTA2VG1iX2M/view?usp=sharing) if you'd like).
2. Send your invoice to josephineinc@bill.com and CC your direct report. 

The first time you do this you'll get an email from bill.com to sign up and enter your direct deposit information. Once your info is set up, your invoices go through approval (by direct report) and then payment (by our accountant). Turn around is usually ~3 business days so let us know if there's a rush!
