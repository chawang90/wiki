### Crop it to a square

 Save two copies, one named avatar-small.jpg, the other named avatar.jpg. 
 Hint: One pretty easy to do this in Preview by using the crop tool, together with the Adjust Size tool

1. `avatar-small.jpg` –– 150x150px
2. `avatar.jpg` -- 500x500px (or larger, but don't go crazy. Consider download filesize.)
