# Reading List

We strive to always be learning. Reading is fundamental. ABC, 123.

## Pair Programming

We love pair programming. It helps keep us focused, allows us to learn new things from each other, and gives us an opportunity to understand how the other person works which builds trust.

Here are some nice articles on pairing and how to do it well.
